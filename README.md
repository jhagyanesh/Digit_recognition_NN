# Digit_recognition_NN
In this project, we will build a complete neural network using Numpy. we will implement all the steps required to build a network - feedforward, loss computation, backpropagation, weight updates etc. We will use the MNIST dataset to train your model to classify handwritten digits between 0-9.
